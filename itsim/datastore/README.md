#Itsim Datastore

The datastore provides a way for itsim to archive and query simulation data and logs.

The datastore is meant to be a generic interface for accessing data regardless of its storage location. The datastore 
can either be used through its local api or remotely using a rest api. Data can be stored on a remote PostgreSQL 
database or a local SQLite database (eventually support local folders?). 



```
Simulator       Datastore                       Database
Instance
                                            ___ remote PostgreSQL
itsim   -----> datastore local api         /
           \                         -----
            --> datastore rest api         \___ local SQLite (support remote as well?)        
            
```

### PostgreSQL vs SQLite

- PostgreSQL: requires a database server to be running (setup inside a docker?). Supports JSON, UUIDs natively.
- SQLite: Easier to setup and work with, datastore needs a single db file (no server). JSON, UUIDs aren't natively 
supported.


### Note:
This datastore implementation shares similarities with the [ElementAI](https://github.com/ElementAI)/**eai-dataset-store**
project, which has a primary focus on "freezing" dataset versions in local folders. At maturity, those projects could be 
merged into a single datastore implementation. This would require a generalized approach to define dataset entries and 
structure...
