    A simple generic class representing a physical connection between a set of machines.

    wireless transmission is detectable, all messages must be received by all parties.
    Trust and security must be handled outside of the Link class.

    In addition, this class uses the Address class, but does not perform any logic with it aside from simple matching.
    The use of Address is only a convenience here, and it is meant to be an arbitrary label for a Node on the Link.
    It serves no purpose other than allowing the Node to be uniquely identified for addition and removal.
    Any address management for allocating unique and meaningful Address objects to Nodes should be
    handled outside of this class.
